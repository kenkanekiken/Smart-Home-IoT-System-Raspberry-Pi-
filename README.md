# Smart-Home-IoT-System-Raspberry-Pi-
An IoT-based smart home automation project built on Raspberry Pi, featuring real-time environmental monitoring and automated appliance control. The system reads temperature, humidity, and pressure data from a BME280 sensor and intelligently activates a fan using GPIO-controlled relays when predefined thresholds are exceeded.
